Welcome to LexPipe. Your privacy and the security of your data are of paramount importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how it is used, shared, and protected.

## Policy

### Information Collection

We collect information necessary to provide our services, including legal data, 
personal details, and usage statistics. Data is collected via our platform, through direct interactions with our users, and from third-party legal data providers.

Data is shared with service providers under contract (e.g., Google Cloud). We
disclose data when required by law or to protect our rights.

### Data Security

We implement robust security measures to protect data against unauthorized access 
and breaches.

### User Rights

Users have rights to access, correct, or delete their personal information. To
exercise these rights, please contact us at info@lexpipe.com.
